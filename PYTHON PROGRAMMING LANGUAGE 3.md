## 3.1. Functions & Recursion
### Function
  - is a block of code that performs a specific task.
  - help as to do our work in small chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.
  `TYPES OF FUNTIONS`
1. Standard library functions
    - are built-in functions in python  
	- example:- print(), len(), input() ...
2. User-defined functions
    - that we can create our own created functions.
    - `how to creat`: use 'def '
    - use  of arguments: to assign the numbers or objectives for the formula.
    - use of return statement: to made our function return the value to a function call.
    Disadvantage of function:

### Recursion
 - is process of defining sth in terms of itself.
## 3.2. Lambda Functions
- is function but doesn't have name.
- it will return by default.

### Function takers function
-For Example: filter, map & reduce takes a function as an argument.
### Filter Function
- is used to filter or search some function from sequences.
### Map Function
- used to do some mathematical operations on sequences.

## 3.3.OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) & POP

### OOP
- python is one of the example of oop.
- Objects have attributes(properties) and methods(action / functions) or behaviour.
     - attribute = name, size, cpu, ram 
     - behaviour = running games, playing music, displaying texts...
### POP
- to break blocks of codes to smaller ones.
## 3.4. Class & Objects

### class
- class: where we create our object's attribute and behavior.

### objects
![[Pasted image 20240810232028.png]]
- `type()`: is to check our type of int.

- Giving Behaviors == creating methods on oop

## 3.5. User-Built Module

### Python Constructors

### Python Inheritance

- is a way of creating new class with some properties of existing class.
![[Pasted image 20240811012201.png]]

### Python Encapsulation

- refers to bundling of attributes and methods inside a single class.
- it ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through specified methods.

### Python installing

- on python terminal (pip install packagesname)
### Python Using
- import ./file name.py :-is pakages use to run other opened file on python while being on other file where the import./file name.py existed.
- so to use the packages make ` import <pakage name>`
