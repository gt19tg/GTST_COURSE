# 1.3. WHY PYTHON IS USED IN HACKING
- Availability of Ready-Made Modules: an outstanding feature that makes hacking easy with python is the availability of ready-made modules.
     **depending on the target for example:- OS modules, SOCKET modules, and ...
# 1.4. HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON 
# 1.5. WHAT IS IDE AND CODE EDITOR
 - `IDE(Integrated Development Environment)`: is a software that helps to writ and run a specific programing language.
 - `Code editors`: is a software thoes can help to write any kind of programming languages. And also by adding some compiling/ interpreting feature they can run programs/scripts.
