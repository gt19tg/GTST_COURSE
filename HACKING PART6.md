# 6.1. What is Cryptography?
---
 - Cryptography: is the science of secret, or hidden writing.
 - crypto = hidden/ secret
 - graphy = writing
 `USES`
 A. encryption:![[Pasted image 20240907231629.png]]
 * CIPHER: is a method for encryption messages. & ==key== :it is also string numbers or characters.
